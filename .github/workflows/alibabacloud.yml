# This workflow will build and push a new container image to Alibaba Cloud Container Registry (ACR),
# and then will deploy it to Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK), when there is a push to the "main" branch.
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
#
# 1. Create an ACR repository to store your container images.
#    You can use ACR EE instance for more security and better performance.
#    For instructions see https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/142168.htm
#
# 2. Create an ACK cluster to run your containerized application.
#    You can use ACK Pro cluster for more security and better performance.
#    For instructions see https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/95108.htm
#
# 3. Store your AccessKey pair in GitHub Actions secrets named `ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`.
#    For instructions on setting up secrets see: https://developer.github.com/actions/managing-workflows/storing-secrets/
#
# 4. Change the values for the REGION_ID, REGISTRY, NAMESPACE, IMAGE, ACK_CLUSTER_ID, and ACK_DEPLOYMENT_NAME.
